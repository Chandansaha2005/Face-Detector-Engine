# FaceNet model directory

Place your FaceNet Keras model file here.

Expected files:
- `facenet_keras.h5` — Keras model (download separately)
- `20180402-114759/` — optional original TensorFlow model files (if available)

Do not commit large model files to the repository; consider using Git LFS or keeping the model outside version control.
